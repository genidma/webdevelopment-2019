	Bill Gates, co-founded <em>Microsoft</em> along with Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer and others. Gates has also been actively involved in philanthropy and impact pledges along with his wife, Melinda Gates and his friend Warren Buffett.<p></p>

	I wonder what the difference between '< em >' and '< i >' would be?. <br>

	Overall: I threw some other tags in there for fun. Like the marquee tag. Because, why not?
